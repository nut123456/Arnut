This paper explores the chaotic enhanced leader slime mold algorithm (CELSMA), an advanced bio-inspired optimization technique specifically designed for addressing high-dimensional problems. By expanding on the conventional slime mold algorithm (SMA), CELSMA incorporates the guidance of three leader candidates to enhance both exploration and exploitation capabilities. CELSMA utilizes both ergodic and non-repetitive properties of chaotic maps to improve the exploration of solution space. The risk of premature convergence and becoming trapped in local optima is reduced. This study focuses on the size optimization of truss structures under frequency constraints, which is a computationally intensive issue due to eigenvalue calculations. The largest eigenvalues of sparse matrix (LESM) technique is presented. LESM effectively reduces computational time, thus enabling the feasibility of large-scale truss optimization. The CELSMA-LESM approach has undergone rigorous evaluation through the optimization of large dome structures, which are benchmarked against established algorithms. Results demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of CELSMA, as it achieves optimal solutions with fewer iterations.
